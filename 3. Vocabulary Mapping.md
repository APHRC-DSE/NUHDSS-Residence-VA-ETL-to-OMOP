## Introduction
Sometimes the source data uses coding systems that are not in the Vocabulary. In this case, a mapping must be created from the source coding system to the Standard Concepts. 
Code mapping can be a daunting task, especially when there are many codes in the source coding system. For this dataset, I used Usagi to map vocabularies of source concepts. 
## Usagi 
Usagi is a tool to aid the manual process of creating a code mapping. It can make suggested mappings based on textual similarity of code descriptions. 
If the source codes are only available in a foreign language, we have found that Google Translate often gives surprisingly good translation of the terms into English. 
Usagi allows the user to search for the appropriate target concepts if the automated suggestion is not correct. 
Finally, the user can indicate which mappings are approved to be used in the ETL. Usagi is available on GitHub.
## Process Overview
The typical sequence for using this software is:
- Load codes from your sources system (“source codes”) that you would like to map to Vocabulary concepts.
- Usagi will run a term similarity approach to map source codes to Vocabulary concepts.
- Leverage Usagi interface to check, and where needed, improve suggested mappings. Preferably an individual who has experience with the coding system and medical terminology should be used for this review.
- Export mapping to the Vocabulary’s SOURCE_TO_CONCEPT_MAP.
