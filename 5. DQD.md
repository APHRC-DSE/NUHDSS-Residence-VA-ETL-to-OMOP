## Data Quality Dashboard 
The goal of the Data Quality Dashboard (DQD) project is to design and develop an open-source tool to expose and evaluate observational data quality.
This package will run a series of data quality checks against an OMOP CDM instance (currently supports v5.4, v5.3 and v5.2). It systematically runs the checks, evaluates the checks against some pre-specified threshold, 
and then communicates what was done in a transparent and easily understandable way.
